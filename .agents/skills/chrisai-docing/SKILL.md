# ChrisAI Docing

Use this skill for technical writing and developer-facing technical
documentation. Route the task to the narrowest internal workflow or reference
unless the request clearly needs a deliberate sequence.

Do not use this skill for general documentation tasks such as business docs,
marketing copy, operational policy, project planning notes, or non-technical
knowledge-base writing unless the user explicitly asks to treat that material
as developer-facing technical documentation.

Do not treat the workflow and reference files as separate skills. They are
internal guidance for this consolidated skill.

## Internal Guidance

- Use `workflows/copy-editing.md` when the user asks to proofread, tighten,
  clarify, simplify, or improve existing documentation without changing its
  technical meaning or owning its information architecture.
- Use `references/guided-learning.md` when the user asks to create or
  restructure quick starts, tutorials, getting-started guides, conceptual
  explanations, first-success flows, reader journeys, teaching style, guided
  walkthroughs, or progressive-disclosure docs.
- Use `references/api-reference.md` when the user asks to write, restructure,
  or review lookup-oriented docs for APIs, modules, classes, functions,
  methods, CLI commands, config, schemas, parameters, return values, errors,
  or typed usage examples.
- Use `references/formatting.md` when the user asks to normalize markdown
  presentation after the content strategy is clear, including headings, TOCs,
  outline numbering, spacing, list style, code fence language tags, links,
  anchors, and repo style-guide conformance.

## Sequencing

Only chain internal guidance when there is a clear owner plus a clear
follow-up. Use this order:

1. `references/guided-learning.md` or `references/api-reference.md` first
   when the task needs content ownership.
2. `workflows/copy-editing.md` second when the prose needs an editorial pass.
3. `references/formatting.md` last when the output still needs markdown or
   structure cleanup.

Do not default to multi-step documentation sequences.

## Decision Rules

- If the request mixes guided learning and reference, choose the primary user
  goal first; only add formatting later if needed.
- If the request is mainly about proofreading, clarity, transitions, or tone
  rather than document ownership, use `workflows/copy-editing.md`.
- If the request is mainly about lookup-oriented API, class, module, function,
  configuration, or typed example material, use
  `references/api-reference.md`.
- If the request is mainly about a quick start, tutorial, conceptual guide, or
  junior-developer learning path, use `references/guided-learning.md`.
- If the document type is already correct and the task is markdown structure,
  outline numbering, links, TOC, spacing, or style cleanup, use
  `references/formatting.md`.
