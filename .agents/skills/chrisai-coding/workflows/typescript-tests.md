# ChrisAI Coding TS Tests

Use this workflow only to audit, recommend improvements to, or fix existing
tests and coverage in a local codebase.

## Second Pass Use

This workflow may guide approved test fixes directly, but it is especially
recommended as the final pass after the existing tests already work.

Use the last pass to normalize scenario comments, JSDoc coverage, declaration
comments, and readability without changing already-correct test
behavior.

## Repo Discovery Workflow

Before enforcing test conventions, inspect the local codebase in this order:

1. the touched test file and nearby suites
2. test runner, assertion, and mocking libraries in config and dependencies
3. helper builders, fixtures, and shared setup already used nearby
4. whether the package expects unit, integration, DOM, or mixed testing

If the codebase already has a stronger local pattern, preserve it. Use this
workflow to resolve ambiguity and keep test fixes aligned with the existing
stack.

## Task Intake

Decide whether the existing-test task is mainly:

- repairing coverage for existing behavior
- fixing a broken or flaky test
- reviewing a test change
- recommending where a missing existing-behavior test should live

If the correct test level is unclear, read
`references/typescript-tests-test-selection.md` before recommending or fixing
assertions.

## Priority Order

Apply rules in this order:

1. Match the existing test framework and style in the touched codebase or file.
2. Apply the standards in this workflow.
3. If a local pattern conflicts with this workflow, preserve the local pattern
   unless the user asks to normalize or migrate it.

Do not switch a codebase from Jest to Mocha/Chai, or the reverse, unless the user
explicitly asks for a migration.

## Framework Selection

- Use Jest rules when the codebase or touched tests already use Jest.
- Use Mocha + Chai rules when the codebase or touched tests already use them.
- For React component tests, prefer the codebase's existing React testing stack.
- When no framework is obvious, inspect the codebase before fixing tests and pick
  the framework already present in configuration, dependencies, or nearby test
  files.

## Coverage Targets

- Unless the user says otherwise, acceptable coverage is above `70%`.
- Treat `80%` as the default deployment-ready target.
- Do not stretch for `>90%` coverage unless it happens naturally.
- Increase coverage only when it fixes an existing behavior gap. Add meaningful
  tests around real behavior instead of padding trivial lines or over-mocking.
- Focus first on conditionals, branches, error paths, loops, and public
  side-effects.

## Shared Testing Principles

- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Keep tests fast, isolated, deterministic, and runnable in any order.
- Avoid real network, filesystem, clock, randomness, environment, or process
  dependencies unless the test is explicitly integration-level.
- Mock or stub only true boundaries. Do not mock the code under test into
  tautologies.
- Prefer builders or typed factories over large static fixtures.
- Keep one clear behavior theme per test. Multiple related assertions are fine
  when they describe the same behavior.
- Remove `.only`, hidden global state, and order dependence before finishing.
- Fix type errors and remove unused variables before trying to run tests.

## Commenting Style For Tests

The user prefers many comments that explain what each test is trying to prove.
Bias toward more comments, not fewer, when the flow or intent is not obvious.

- Treat comments as part of the author's signature, not optional decoration.
- Minimum comment density is per logical block.
- Increase comment density toward line-by-line when a test branches, carries
  state, or would otherwise hide why the scenario matters.
- Add short `//` comments before setup, action, and assertion blocks when
  practical.
- Story-style comments are welcome when they still stay local to the scenario
  they narrate.
- Explain the scenario, why the setup matters, and what the test is attempting
  to validate.
- For multi-line conditionals, loops, callbacks, and ternaries, comment the
  condition and the consequence or branch separately when that improves
  scanning.
- For one-line conditionals, one-line ternaries, compact loops, and short
  inline callbacks that fit the line-length rules, one combined comment is
  acceptable.
- Keep comments factual and local to the code they describe.
- Prefer several small comments over one large paragraph.
- Let the comments read top-to-bottom like a guided walkthrough of the test.
- Follow the project inline comment style: `//Comment`, not `// Comment`.
- Use a space after `//` on continuation lines of the same wrapped comment
  block.
- Use `/** ... */` JSDoc on every function and class method, no matter how
  small, including local helpers and shared test builders.
- Keep JSDoc to a short description by default. Do not add `@param`,
  `@returns`, or similar tags unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Add `//` comments above class properties and exported fixtures, builders,
  types, constants, and other declarations when the comment helps explain what
  they are, where they are used, or how they are used.
- Do not leave commented-out code in committed work.

For concrete patterns and when-to-apply examples, load:

- `references/typescript-tests-commenting-style.md`
- `references/typescript-tests-jsdoc-and-declaration-comments.md`
- `references/typescript-tests-test-style-pass.md`

Example:

```ts
//Build a user with a valid default shape first so this test only changes
//the field that matters for the failing branch.
const user = makeUser({ email: '' });

//Run the public validator instead of touching internal helper methods so
//the test stays stable during refactors.
const result = validateUser(user);

//Confirm the validator rejects the bad email in the same way production
//callers would observe it.
expect(result.ok).to.equal(false);
```

## Test Naming And Structure

- Use descriptive `describe` and `it` titles that read like behavior.
- Avoid vague names like `test getUser` or `works`.
- Group related scenarios together, but keep tests independent.
- Prefer local setup inside the test unless shared hooks clearly reduce noise.
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for resettable state.
- Use `before` and `after` only for expensive setup that is truly safe to
  share.

## TypeScript Rules In Tests

- Respect strict TypeScript rules in tests the same way as production code.
- Never use `any` unless the user explicitly accepts it. Prefer `unknown` and
  narrow before asserting.
- Prefer `satisfies` over `as` when validating object shapes.
- Add small narrowing helpers when repeated error or union checks would
  otherwise clutter tests.
- Keep test helpers typed so mocks, fixtures, and builders fail loudly when
  production contracts change.

## Determinism And Boundaries

- Fake or control time for time-dependent tests.
- Stub randomness, UUID generation, dates, and unstable environment values.
- Silence logs when they create noise without adding signal.
- Use unique temp paths or in-memory replacements when filesystem behavior
  matters.
- Assert on owned error messages or error shape, not brittle third-party
  wording.

## Jest Rules

- Mirror the local codebase's existing Jest file placement. If there is no clear local
  pattern, prefer mirrored test paths.
- Always await async work.
- Prefer explicit assertions over large snapshots.
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to reset mocks and modules when the suite
  needs it.
- Use `findBy` queries, `waitFor`, or resolved promises instead of timeouts.
- Mock only boundaries such as I/O, network, time, randomness, and browser
  APIs.
- For React tests, prefer React Testing Library and user-observable behavior.
- Use `@testing-library/user-event` for interaction flows when that stack is
  present.
- Do not use shallow rendering.

Jest-specific pitfalls:

- If `mockResolvedValue` infers `never`, give the mock an explicit promise
  return type.
- If `describe`, `it`, or `expect` are untyped, make sure test tsconfig types
  include Jest.

## Mocha + Chai Rules

- Standardize on `expect` assertions when the codebase uses Chai.
- Use `async/await` and promise-based assertions. Do not use `done` callbacks.
- Use `chai-as-promised` and `sinon-chai` when the codebase already depends on
  them.
- Create a Sinon sandbox for suites or tests that stub behavior, and restore it
  in `afterEach`.
- Use fake timers for time-dependent behavior and always restore them.
- Keep Chai assertions focused on observable outcomes and visible side-effects.

## React Test Rules

- Test the DOM and interactions the way a user experiences them.
- Prefer roles, labels, and accessible names over brittle selectors.
- Test effects through visible behavior, not hook internals.
- Avoid giant snapshots and implementation-coupled assertions.

## Coding Standards Inside Tests

- Match the style of the surrounding local codebase first.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation. Never use tabs.
- Prefer single quotes for strings.
- Use template literals for interpolation or multiline text.
- Use double quotes only when target syntax requires it, such as JSX or HTML
  attributes.
- End statements with semicolons.
- Do not add semicolons after `if`, `for`, or `while` blocks.
- Do end `do...while` statements with a semicolon.
- Aim for `<= 80` characters when practical.
- Avoid going past `100` characters unless the file already does so
  consistently.
- Keep one blank line between logical blocks.
- Avoid multiple consecutive blank lines.
- Use spaces inside non-empty arrays and objects.
- Use empty arrays and objects as `[]` and `{}`.
- Use descriptive names instead of single-letter names or unclear
  abbreviations.

## Review Checklist

Before finishing test work, verify that:

- the file received a final style pass after the tests were already working
- the chosen framework matches the local codebase
- the tests assert public behavior
- mocks and stubs stop at real boundaries
- async tests await all meaningful work
- time, randomness, and shared state are controlled
- comments explain the scenario and intent of each non-trivial test
- every function and class method has JSDoc
- shared declarations have `//Comment` guidance where it clarifies role or
  usage
- coverage is above `70%`, with `80%` as the default deployment-ready target
- there is no `.only`, dead code, or unused setup left behind
