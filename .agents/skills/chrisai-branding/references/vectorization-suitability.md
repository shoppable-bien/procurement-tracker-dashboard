# Vectorization Suitability

PNG-to-SVG conversion is not automatically an upgrade.

Use vectorization only when the raster source is already close to vector-like.

## Good Candidates

Good PNG-to-SVG candidates usually have:

- strong silhouette separation
- few colors
- clean flat fills
- limited or no gradients
- little or no texture

Common good cases:

- black-and-white icons
- simple flat logos
- badges with broad shape regions
- stencil-like artwork

## Poor Candidates

Avoid PNG-to-SVG conversion when the source has:

- photo content
- brush texture
- soft shading
- transparency-heavy edges
- glow effects
- shadows
- anti-aliased text or screenshots
- hair, fur, smoke, liquids, or glass

## Decision Rule

Ask one question:

Would a designer reasonably maintain this as vector after conversion?

If the answer is no, keep the asset as PNG and explain why.

For generated logo work, keeping the PNG means keeping it as exploratory
reference only. Do not present it as a candidate or continue refinements from
it. Stop and explain that the direction is not suitable for the required SVG
logo workflow. For non-logo brand assets, PNG may remain the master.
