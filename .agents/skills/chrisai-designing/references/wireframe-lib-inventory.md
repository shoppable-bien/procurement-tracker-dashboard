# Wireframing Library Inventory

Use this inventory to select source files from
[`../assets/wireframes/lib/`](../assets/wireframes/lib/).
Copy only files used by the current revision's `specs.md`. Do not copy
`samples/` into target project wireframes unless the user explicitly asks for
review samples.

HTML files beside component and layout CSS are canonical, copyable markup.
Adapt their content, IDs, links, and initial state to the revision. Sample HTML
files are complete review pages and are not source templates.

When this inventory has no suitable source, use
[Wireframe Composition Rules](wireframe-composition-rules.md) to compose the
custom element from established tokens and patterns.
