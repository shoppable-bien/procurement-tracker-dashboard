# Browser Feedback Loop

Use this reference when a task shows a draft, prototype, rendered page, local
app, screenshot, recording, or other reviewable artifact in the in-app browser.

## Terminology

A review round is one feedback cycle inside a phase:

1. show the user a browser-visible artifact
2. tell the user what to review
3. the user gives feedback
4. revise based on that feedback
5. repeat until that phase is approved

Each phase may have many review rounds before it is approved.

A revision is a folder-level artifact version created for a major change.
Revisions are not the same thing as review rounds. For example, a wireframe
phase may go through 10 review rounds and only 3 major revisions if most rounds
were minor refinements inside existing revision folders.

Review-round approval is not the same as phase approval. If the user approves
one review round, advance to the exact next step stated for that round. Do not
advance to an unstated next step.

If the stated next step is another review round in the same phase, continue
there. If the stated next step is the next phase, continue only when the full
current phase scope is complete.

Annotation-based feedback, ad hoc notes, comments on screenshots, written
change lists, and direct chat feedback all count as review feedback. Apply the
feedback through the owning workflow, then present the updated artifact through
another review round until the phase is approved.

When generated artifact files are created or changed, the current revision
folder must include `notes.md` with one entry per update or review round.
Those notes prevent later creative and frontend work from drifting away from
the approved review decisions.

## Required Round Response

After every browser-visible round, use this structure unless the round is tiny:

```markdown
Done. <Phase Name>, Round <n> is ready at:

[<review target>](<review target>)

Notes:
[<notes.md>](<notes target>)

What changed:
- <specific change>
- <specific change>

Verified:
- <specific check that passed>
- <specific check that passed>

Please review:
- <concrete question tied to the visible artifact>
- <concrete question tied to the visible artifact>

If you approve this review round, the next step is <exact next step>. If not, tell me
which <areas/screens/states/metrics/flow points> to revise.
```

The review target may be a URL, file path, artifact name, screenshot,
recording, or browser route. Put it on its own line so it is easy to find.
Include the notes link when generated files were created or changed. Omit it
only for review rounds that did not produce or modify files.

Use "Verified" only for checks that were actually run. If no verification was
run, omit the section or say what still needs verification.

For non-design domains, adapt the labels without losing the structure. For
example, a workbook, report, or data artifact can still use `What changed`,
`Verified`, `Please review`, and an approval sentence.

Every response must still communicate:

- what changed
- what the user should review now, phrased as specific questions
- what feedback would be most useful
- what happens next if this review round is approved
- whether more review rounds remain before the next phase
- what happens next if revisions are needed

The user should be able to approve the round and have the agent move to exactly
the stated next step without asking again.

Avoid paragraph-only review-round responses when more than one review question or
verification item exists. Paragraph summaries make approval paths easy to miss.

## Review Questions

Prefer concrete, answerable questions over generic review requests. Questions
should refer to the actual pages, screens, sections, states, flow decisions,
visual decisions, interactions, screenshots, recordings, or browser-visible
behavior changed in that round.

Good review questions:

- Does the revised navigation model match how users should move through these
  pages?
- Is this the right page set for the first browser review round, or is a
  screen missing?
- Does the primary action land in the right section?
- Does the desktop article structure still work after separating the pages?
- Should this state get its own screen, or is it enough as a section inside
  the existing screen?
- Does the simulated interaction communicate the intended behavior clearly?

Avoid vague review prompts:

- Thoughts?
- Does this look good?
- Please review the draft.

## Artifact Rules

Major changes should create a new revision folder when files are generated.
Major changes include new layout directions, changed navigation models, added
screens, removed screens, substantial section reordering, new visual
directions, major component treatment changes, or a materially different
interactive flow.

Minor changes may update the current revision folder. Minor changes include
copy labels, small spacing adjustments, color token tweaks, local section
changes, and small state clarifications.

Name revision folders clearly enough to make the phase history readable, such
as `r001-wireframe-dashboard`, `r002-wireframe-navigation-rework`, or
`r003-creative-functional-flow`. Review-round metadata may live inside the
current revision folder.

Every generated-artifact update must append or update `notes.md` in the
current revision folder. Each entry should include:

- round number, date, and short label
- changed screens, states, copy, layout, or behavior
- what should be reviewed next
- feedback, annotations, screenshot notes, or chat notes applied
- simulated, illustrative, deferred, or non-production behavior
- open questions
- exact approval path

When QA screenshots, recordings, or notes are produced for the round, keep them
with the artifact being reviewed unless the owning domain skill says otherwise.

## Browser Safety

If the in-app browser is unavailable, say so and provide the review target as a
URL or file path. Do not claim a browser review happened.

If the browser shows a blank page, load error, missing asset, or broken
interaction, report that as the current review-round status before asking for
approval.

If behavior is simulated, say what is simulated. Do not imply that simulated
behavior is production behavior.

## Phase Safety

Do not say "next step: implementation" unless the full design, draft, or
prototype phase is complete and the previous round explicitly stated that
implementation was next.

Do not say "next step: creative design" unless the full wireframe phase is
complete. If approval only unlocks the next sample set, state that instead.

Do not advance from browser-visible review into production implementation
unless the agent explicitly stated that as the next step and the current phase
scope is complete.
