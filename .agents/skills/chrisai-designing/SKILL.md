# ChrisAI Designing

Use this skill for design work. Route the task to the narrowest
internal workflow or reference unless the request clearly needs a deliberate
sequence.

Use precise review terminology:

- A review round is a feedback cycle.
- A revision is a major folder-level artifact version.
- Major changes create a new revision folder.
- Minor changes may stay in the current revision folder.

Wireframes, creative drafts, clickable drafts, and functional creatives must
use `workflows/feedback-loop.md` until the relevant phase is approved, including
when feedback arrives as annotations, screenshot notes, ad hoc requests, or
direct chat comments.

Generated wireframes and creative drafts must be HTML/CSS/JS review artifacts.
Do not deliver markdown-only wireframes, markdown mockups, or prose-only
creative drafts unless the user explicitly asks for text-only planning instead
of generated files.

Rendered wireframes, creative drafts, clickable drafts, and functional
creatives must show only intended product UI. Do not render agent annotations,
review notes, implementation commentary, TODO labels, annotative placeholders,
or explanatory callouts inside the HTML interface. Realistic illustrative
content is allowed when product truth is unavailable, but it must not be
visibly labeled as placeholder or annotation content. Put review context,
assumptions, simulated-behavior notes, deferred states, open questions, and
handoff guidance in companion Markdown files inside the revision folder.
Every update that changes a generated wireframe, creative draft, clickable
draft, or functional creative must append or update a companion `notes.md`
review-round entry that records what changed, what should be reviewed,
feedback or annotations applied, simulated behavior, open questions, and the
exact next approval path.

Generated wireframes, creative drafts, clickable drafts, and functional
creatives must use document-relative links for pages, scripts, styles, and
draft assets. Prefer links such as `./index.html`, `./checkout.html`,
`./styles.css`, `./script.js`, and `../assets/logo.png`. Do not assume the
draft is hosted from a web root, and do not use root-relative paths such as
`/index.html`, `/styles.css`, or `/assets/logo.png` inside portable static
review artifacts.

## Internal Guidance

- Use `workflows/creative-direction.md` when the task needs coordinated
  creative direction, visual-system definition, homepage or landing-page
  composition, brand adaptation, reference-site synthesis, or a
  pre-artifact design-direction handoff.
- Use `workflows/design-system-extraction.md` when the task needs existing
  app, site, Figma, design-system, component-library, screenshot, exported
  design-file, or local theme-source inspection before extending a product.
- Use `workflows/wireframe-drafts.md` when the task needs document-driven
  HTML/CSS/JS grayscale low-fidelity wireframes, layout options, flow
  structure, or clickable grayscale wireframe drafts.
- Use `workflows/design-drafts.md` when the task needs static HTML/CSS/JS
  design-review artifacts, clickable creative drafts, functional creative
  drafts, or polished visual mockups from an approved structure and direction.
- Use `workflows/feedback-loop.md` whenever a draft, prototype, rendered page,
  local app, screenshot, recording, or other browser-visible artifact needs
  review questions, review-round approval, phase approval, and exact next-step
  language.
- Use `workflows/design-handoff-package.md` when the user asks to document,
  explain, package, summarize, or hand off generated wireframes and/or
  creatives. Generate a final package from approved revisions. Generate an
  interim package from pending or unknown revisions only when the user
  explicitly requests pre-approval documentation.

## Supporting References

- Use `references/design-modes.md` to classify the design mode before choosing
  a workflow.
- Use `references/brand-led-discovery.md`,
  `references/existing-design-sources.md`, `references/homepage-patterns.md`,
  `references/site-direction-playbooks.md`, and `references/visual-review.md`
  during creative-direction work.
- Use `references/source-formats.md` and
  `references/extraction-report.md` during design-system extraction.
- Use `references/wireframe-specs-contract.md`,
  `references/wireframe-implementation-rules.md`,
  `references/wireframe-revision-workflow.md`, and
  `references/wireframe-review-workflow.md` during wireframe work.
- Use `references/wireframe-lib-inventory.md` to select bundled wireframe
  layouts, components, icons, utilities, and behavioral samples before
  creating new equivalents.
- Use `references/wireframe-composition-rules.md` after library lookup when a
  wireframe needs custom elements or compositions, including table-like data
  collections.
- Use `references/creative-draft-specs-contract.md`,
  `references/creative-draft-implementation-rules.md`,
  `references/creative-draft-revision-workflow.md`, and
  `references/creative-draft-review-workflow.md` during creative draft work.
- Use `references/draft-artifact-rules.md` during static draft creation.
- Use `references/browser-feedback-loop.md` during browser-visible review
  rounds.
- Use `references/evidence-scripts.md` when objective extraction scripts can
  provide useful evidence.
- Use `references/wireframe-routing.md` only as a bridge when a creative
  direction task turns into low-fidelity structure work.

## Soft Capability Lookup

Use installed capabilities opportunistically, but do not require them:

- For logo creation or refinement, look for an available logo-generation skill,
  plugin, local tool, or project workflow. If none exists, produce best-effort
  logo direction or lightweight SVG guidance without claiming a dedicated logo
  workflow was used.
- For image generation, look for an available image-generation capability such
  as a skill, plugin, or image tool. If none exists, use placeholders, existing
  assets, SVG/static guidance, or ask for source assets when needed.
- For production HTML, CSS, or JavaScript implementation, look for an
  available frontend, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, app implementation, or
  project-local coding workflow. If none exists, keep the output at the
  design-artifact or handoff level.
- For browser-visible review, use the Browser plugin when available. If it is
  unavailable, provide the local URL or file path and state that browser review
  was not performed.

If no matching capability is available, state any limits.

## Sequencing

Only chain internal guidance when there is a clear owner plus a clear
follow-up. Use this order:

1. `workflows/design-system-extraction.md` first when existing product rules
   must be understood before new design work.
2. `workflows/creative-direction.md` when the visual direction, design mode, or
   brand-led system is still open.
3. `workflows/wireframe-drafts.md` when structure, hierarchy, or flow must be
   specified and approved before visual design.
4. `workflows/design-drafts.md` when a static review artifact is needed from an
   approved structure and direction.
5. `workflows/feedback-loop.md` whenever an artifact is shown for review.
6. `workflows/design-handoff-package.md` after the latest wireframe and/or
   creative artifacts are approved, or when the user asks for documentation or
   handoff material.

Do not default to multi-step design sequences.

## Decision Rules

- If the request is mainly about creative direction, visual-system work,
  homepage composition, or pre-artifact design-direction handoff, use
  `workflows/creative-direction.md`.
- If the request is mainly about extracting rules from an existing design
  source of truth, use `workflows/design-system-extraction.md`.
- If the request is mainly about grayscale wireframes or clickable grayscale
  wireframes, use `workflows/wireframe-drafts.md`.
- If the request is mainly about static design-review artifacts, clickable
  creative drafts, or mockups from approved structure and direction, use
  `workflows/design-drafts.md`.
- If a browser-visible artifact is part of the task, apply
  `workflows/feedback-loop.md` before asking the user for approval.
- If the request is mainly about documenting generated design artifacts, use
  `workflows/design-handoff-package.md` and include interaction behavior,
  component identity, states, assumptions, implementation priority, and open
  questions.
